# MySQL Hiking Trail Management System Database

### üí¨ Project Description

This MySQL database is designed to manage a collection of different hiking trails, locations, users, reviews, and the relationships between them. It also includes stored procedures for common database operations, two views for reading trails popularity in Europe and North America, as well as a folder for connecting the database to a Node js application.

## üßµ Project Structure

1. `pa1/` folder that contains three `.sql` files:\
   `pa1/schema.sql`: contains all the tables used in the whole project.
   `pa1/table_population.sql`: populates all the tables with data.
   `pa1/queries.sql`: contains all queries required for practical assignment 1.
2. `pa2/` folder that contains three `.sql` files:\
   `pa2/schema_updates.sql`: adds a new table, responsible for establishing many-to-many relationship between tables `trails` and `difficulties`, to our project.\
   `pa2/table_population.sql`: populates the new table with data.
   `pa2/queries.sql`: contains queries that use many-to-many relationships.
3. `pa3/` folder that contains one `.sql` file and `pa3_bonus` folder:\
   `pa3/subqueries.sql`: compares correlated and non-correlated subqueries, as well as contains four queries with: `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`.
   `pa3/pa3_bonus`: a folder that contains a Nodejs server that connects to our database. [Learn more](#bonus).
4. `pa4/` folder that contains two `.sql` files:\
   `pa4/procedures.sql`: creates three stored procedures, with simple database operations, and one transaction that updates the review table.
   `pa4/executions.sql`: calls all the stored procedures and transactions in `pa4/procedures.sql`.
5. `pa5/` folder that contains one `.sql` file:\
   `pa5/views.sql`: indexes `trails` and `reviews` tables, for optimization, and creates two views, that calculate the popularity of trails in Europe and North America.

## üõ´ Deploy the Project

1. You have to install MySQL server on your machine.
2. Install any database administration tool for MySQL, for example, MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, e.t.c.
3. Copy the contents of `pa1/schema.sql` and `pa2/schema_updates.sql` and paste them in the IDE you installed, then run the code to create all the tables this project needs.
4. Copy the contents of `pa1/table_population.sql` and `pa2/table_population.sql` and paste them in the IDE you installed, then run the code to populate the tables with data.
5. If you want, you can also add stored procedures and transactions from `pa4/procedures.sql`, or the views from `pa5/views.sql`.
6. Finally, everything is ready, for you to take any query from any folder of your choice, and run it.
